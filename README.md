# Jelly Jason V

### The Unkillable Server's very own moderation bot

#### ðŸ”´ = Not Active 
#### ðŸŸ¢ = Active

## Commands:

#### ðŸ”´ /event "```Title```", ```Date```, ```Start time```, ```End time```, "```Location```", "```Description```", "```Link```", *optional:* ```@specific, @invities```
The event application will be submitted for an admin to review, if the event is granted a new server event and channel will automatically be created. Any specific invities will then be dm'ed about the event and will automatically be added the the event channel. A message will be sent in #general inviting people to the event. When the start time has passed, Jelly Jason will auto-ping everyone in that channel that the event is starting. The following day after the event, the event channel will be automatically archived and the channel will be able to be viewed by everyone.
